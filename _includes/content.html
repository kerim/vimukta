<h2>About Vimukta</h2>
<p>Vimukta was founded by the producers of the documentary film, [Please Don’t Beat Me, Sir!](http://dontbeatmesir.com) as a means to give something back to the Chhara community featured in that film. Over time we hope to expand our efforts to help other Denotified and Nomadic Tribes (DNTs) in India. Our name comes from the term Vimukta Jati which is another name for DNTs. It also means “free” or “liberated” in Hindi.</p>

<p>Rest assured that 100% of your donation (minus credit card and transaction fees) goes towards funding our current projects.</p>

<p>A registered 501(c)(3) charity organization, your donation to Vimukta is tax-deductible in the United States.</p>
