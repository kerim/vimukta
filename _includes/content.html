<h2>About Vimukta</h2>
<p>Vimukta was founded by the producers of the documentary film, <a href="http://dontbeatmesir.com">Please Don’t Beat Me, Sir!</a> as a means to give something back to India's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denotified_Tribes">Denotified and Nomadic Tribes (DNTs)</a> in India.
